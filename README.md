# Spoken_Language_Identification_Custom_Model

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
The technique that recognizes the language being spoken in an audio recording automatically is known as spoken language identification (SLID), sometimes known as language identification (LID). It's similar to Shazam for languages in that it detects the language based on its acoustic properties rather than the melody of the music. This is an explanation:
<ul>
<li>Audio recording of a spoken word entered.</li>
<li>Output: The recorded language, such as English, Spanish, or French.</li>
</ul>
SLID has a wide range of uses, including
<ul>
<li>Machine translation: Determining the target language for translation is aided by identifying the language of spoken content.</li>
<li>Automatic speech recognition (ASR): Selecting the right ASR system for precise transcription is aided by linguistic knowledge.</li>
<li>Identifying languages for potentially offensive content is known as content moderation.
<li>Putting calls through to customer care representatives who speak the relevant language in many languages.
In this section, we discussed about 3 models for SLID a Custom neural network model  in five languages—English, Tamil, German, French, and Portuguese—is developed, LIDBOX  and Spleechflow open source model.
